# Distributed Execution (Milestone 3)

## Worker CLI
```bash
nauto_cli worker --queue queue/jobs.jsonl --limit 10 --dry-run
```
- Reads JSONL queue entries (`{"job": "...", "inventory": "..."}`).
- Dry-run mode prints dispatch info; regular mode simulates handing jobs to a worker node.
- Future hook: call job engine asynchronously per entry.

## Queue Format
- Stored under `queue/jobs.jsonl`.
- Each line is JSON with job + inventory file paths; generated by orchestrator service (future milestone).

## Roadmap
- Connect worker command to an actual async executor + job engine.
- Introduce message broker (Redis/SQS) once service mode is available.
- Report progress/telemetry back to control plane for dashboards.
